if the deployment is failed with the command:
truffle migrate --network goerli 
You can use :
truffle deploy --compile-none --network goerli

When we use test it is better to use contract instead of describe to allow the clean room features
-You can check that on the website https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/debug-test/write-tests-in-javascript/
-We can use the both contract and describe

-You have to specify the path when you do the test so on develop mode :
test test/file.js
